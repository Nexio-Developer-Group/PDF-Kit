ok now I have made the folder picker page folder_picker_page. and a files_root_page. on this files_root_page I have given shortcuts to navigate directly to the 
- download folder
- screenshots folder
- camera folder
but the problem is they might be stored with different name in different mobiles. so I made 3 variables to store the string in constants.dart file so that through these string the actual location of the download folder, etc could be stored and fetched from the local storage safely without throwing any exception using the storage_utility.dart. so this is logic. in the files_root_page we have default location where they are present in most of the phones. now  we have a global files and folders provider file_system_provider.dart file. so use it to know that if these defualt hard coded locations are present or not. if not then navigate to the folder_picker_page and let the user select the location and save it in the local storage using the storage_utility.dart file. and then navigate to the download folder the users choosed. and from next time the acutall location of download folder will be fetched from the local storgae using the key stored in the constants.dart file. this same thing is to be done in the download folder, screenshot folder and camera location in the files_root_page. fix the file it has errors regarding this issue.
